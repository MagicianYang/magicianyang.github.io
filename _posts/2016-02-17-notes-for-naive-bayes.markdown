### Some Tips for Naive Bayes

#### 1.suitable situations
>This method goes by the name of Naïve Bayes because it’s based on Bayes’ rule
and “naïvely” assumes **independence**—it is only valid to multiply probabilities when
the events are independent. The assumption that attributes are independent (given
the class) in real life certainly is a simplistic one.
