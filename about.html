## About

Welcome to MagicianYang's blog!
I'm a newbie in coding. So I want to write down the notes of coding and manage to organize my own way for learning it.
I love reading novels, watching TV series/movies/cartoons, listening to musics. So maybe I will also record my thoughts about my hobbies.

The blog's name is from a main character in *Legend of Galactic Heroes* (a series of ten science-fiction novels written by Tanaka Yoshiki), whose name is Yang Wen-li. And he is my favourite character. He has  the nicknames "Miracle Yang" and "Yang the Magician" in *Legend of Galactic Heroes*, so I pick one of them as my blog's name. 
The icon is the Tardis from *Doctor Who*(a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC).

Thanks to [*{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme). It is a really beautiful theme for a blog.
And actually, this blog is based on [Jekyll theme](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Try to set up your own blog and enjoy it! (＾ω＾)
